                        <p>Lisk utilises Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). A low-cost, energy efficient, ultra fast consensus algorithm in which delegates are securing the decentralised network. <br><br>Everyone can become a delegate and collect votes from the Lisk community. However, only 101 delegates with the most votes on the network get elected. They generate new blocks in a process called <a href="{{documentation}}" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank">forging</a> and can expect to earn over 12,000 LSK per month. You could become one yourself. All you have to do is setup a node, begin forging and get elected.</p>

                        <p>To become a delegate several steps are necessary to be successful. On the technical side you need to setup a Linux node, install the latest Lisk client on it and maintain it. Additionally, you have to register a delegate account on the Lisk network, configure your Lisk client and activate forging. In order to collect enough votes to be elected you may also write down a proposal on the <a href="https://forum.lisk.io/" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank">Lisk forums</a> and become a regular Lisk community member.<br><br>
<a href="" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank"></a>
                        1.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Deploy a Linux node and install the <a href="/download" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank">latest Lisk client</a> on it. (<a href="{{documentation}}" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank">Documentation</a>, <a href="http://forum.lisk.io/viewforum.php?f=38" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank">Guides</a>)<br>
                        2.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Create a <a href="https://academy.lisk.io/creating-a-new-lisk-account-173820ca424a" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank">new Lisk account</a> and <a href="https://forum.lisk.io/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=1119&p=8869#p8869" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank">register it as a delegate account</a>.<br>
                        3.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Enable forging on your Lisk client with the just registered delegate account.<br>
                        4.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Write down a <a href="https://forum.lisk.io/viewforum.php?f=48" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank">proposal on the Lisk forum</a> why exactly you have to become an active delegate.<br>
                        5.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect <a href="http://i.imgur.com/7J10UTQ.jpg" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank">votes</a> and get elected into the top 101.<br>

                        <p>On block 1,451,520 the forging rewards will be activated with the subsequent activation of community forging. It's a big step forward for Lisk and we are celebrating it with a delegate campaign and a proposal contest. The goal is to get as many delegates with updated proposals as possible so our users have an extensive catalogue of choice.</p>

                                      <p>The goal of this campaign is to get as many delegates as possible and for existing delegates to update their proposals so that LSK holders have the information they need to make an informed decision. If you want to become a delegate you need to setup a Lisk node, register a delegate account on the network and collect enough votes to get elected into the top 101 active delegation.<br><br>
                                      In order to register a delegate account a fee of 25 LSK is paid to the Lisk network. Additionally itâ€™s recommended that you write a proposal on the Lisk forum to increase your chances to be elected as a forging delegate.<br><br>
                                      Until block 1,451,520 is reached we are giving every registered delegate the 25 LSK fee back. The only requirement is to have an up-to-date proposal on the Lisk forums, for which you may receive a bonus of 25 LSK.<br><br></p>

                          <p><strong>1. What is Lisk?</strong></p>
                          <p>Lisk is a crypto-currency and decentralized application platform. As a crypto-currency, much like Bitcoin and other alternatives, it provides a decentralized payment system and digital money network. The network itself, operates using a highly efficient Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus model, that is secured by 101 democratically elected delegates. The Lisk decentralized application platform, it's most powerful component, allows the deployment, distribution and monetisation of decentralized applications onto the Lisk blockchain.</p>
                          <p><strong>2. Who created Lisk?</strong></p>
                          <p>Lisk was founded and is maintained by the <a href="/about" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank">Lisk Foundation</a>, a collective of crypto-currency enthusiasts, developers, designers, entrepreneurs and visionaries. The Lisk Foundation also maintains numerous official Lisk web presences, including this website, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Reddit, a forum, the BTT thread and much more.</p>
                          <p><strong>3. Who controls the Lisk network?</strong></p>
                          <p>The Lisk network is both decentralized and trustless. That means no single entity is in direct control. The network is secured by 101 democratically elected delegates. Whose primary responsibility is to confirm and broadcast the validity of transactions. All Lisk accounts on the network are eligible to vote for delegates registered on the Lisk blockchain. The 101 delegates with the most votes are elected with the responsibility of confirming the validity of transactions broadcast on the network. They also receive 90% of all fees collected by the network, while the foundation receives 10% for funds and contests.</p>
                          <p><strong>4. Why do people trust Lisk?</strong></p>
                          <p>Much of the trust in Lisk comes from the fact that it requires no trust at all. Lisk is fully open-source and decentralized. This means that everyone has access to the entire source code at any time. Developers around the world are therefore free to inspect and verify exactly how Lisk works. All transactions can be transparently audited in real-time by anyone. All payments can be made without reliance on a third party and the whole system is protected by heavily peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms like those used for online banking.</p>

                          <p><strong>1. What is lisk?</strong></p>
                          <p>Every blockchain-based crypto-currency needs a token of value. At Bitcoin the tokens are called BTC or XBT. At Lisk they are called lisk. The abbreviation XLK is used as the ticker for Lisk on various exchanges.</p>
                          <p><strong>2. How are lisk created?</strong></p>
                          <p>All lisk are already in existence. There will never be more lisk than 100,000,000. This is due to the fact that lisk are not mined or generated. All lisk were issued at the inception of the Lisk blockchain and were distributed equally amongst all initial IPO investors. There were nearly 1,000 investors in the IPO.</p>
                          <p><strong>3. What is an IPO?</strong></p>
                          <p>IPO is the abbreviation of Initial Public Offering. It's an often used method to distribute the tokens of Proof-of-Stake based crypto-currencies. In the IPO individuals invested a total of 750 BTC, as a result 85,000,000 lisk were distributed between them. The Lisk Foundation itself got 15,000,000 lisk in order to have an incentive to continue the development of Lisk.</p>
                          <p><strong>4. Where can I buy lisk?</strong></p>
                          <p>Right now lisk can be bought on two exchanges: <a href="https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_lisk" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank">Poloniex.com</a> and <a href="https://bter.com/myaccount/deposit/lisk" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank">Bter.com</a>.</p>

                          <p><strong>1. What are decentralized applications?</strong></p>
                          <p>Decentralized applications are exactly what the name suggests. Applications of any sort running on many servers, providing unseen security, uptime and entirely new business models. Lisk decentralized applications allow the deployment, monetisation, computation and distribution of decentralized applications on the Lisk blockchain.</p>
                          <p><strong>2. What is the difference between decentralized applications, dapps and smart contracts?</strong></p>
                          <p><i>Dapps</i> is the abbreviation of <i>decentralized applications</i>, that means these terms are referring to the same thing. Decentralized applications consist of the whole package of frontend (what you see of an application) and backend (the logic in the background). A smart contract on the other hand, consists only of the backend, and often only a small part of it. That means if you want to create a decentralized application on a smart contract system (i.e. not on Lisk the dapp platform), you have to combine several smart contracts and rely on 3rd party systems for the frontend.</p>
                          <p><strong>3. How do Lisk dapps work?</strong></p>
                          <p>Please take a look at our <a href="http://Lisk.me/Lisk.pdf" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank">white paper</a>.</p>
                          <p><strong>4. How can I make my own dapps?</strong></p>
                          <p>Lisk dapps are developed in JavaScript for the backend and standard web technologies for the frontend. Please take a look at our <a href="{{documentation}}" class="gl_link text_blue" target="_blank">documentation</a> to get detailed guides and tutorials to develop your own dapp.</p>
                          <p><strong>5. Are there any dangers posed by using dapps?</strong></p>
                          <p>Yes. Any passphrases entered into a dapp have the potential to be captured and stolen by the dapp's developer. Which is why you should only ever use open source dapps from well-known trusted developers.</p>

                          <p><strong>1. What is a brainwallet?</strong></p>
                          <p>Lisk uses brain wallets to create accounts and let users access them. That means your account has one passphrase which let you access it. If someone else is typing in the exact same passphrase, they will gain access to your account. That means your passphrase has to be very long and secure, to make it mathematically impossible that someone else won't <i>accidentally</i> use the same one.</p>
                          <p><strong>2. What is a second passphrase?</strong></p>
                          <p>The second passphrase is an additional security layer. Every account can have a second passphrase which needs to be entered whenever you make a transaction. If you store the second passphrase on another device or on a piece of paper, it is similar to a 2-factor-authentification.</p>
                          <p><strong>3. What are Multi-Signature groups?</strong></p>
                          <p>Multi-Signature groups consist of the group owner and up to 15 subordinates, that means a total of 16 (N) accounts. The subordinates need to confirm every transaction from the group owner's account. Every multi-signature group can specify how many (M) confirmations they need. If not enough confirmations are collected, the transaction will not be sent.</p>
